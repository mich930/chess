# Chess
 This is a simple chess bot written in Python with the help of python-chess. 
 I advise using pypy when running it to speed it up, otherwise it may flag often.
 You can try playing it on lichess.org/@/robocik.

## Features:
 - Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
 - Piece-Square Tables
 - Move Ordering
 - Capture Search
 - Syzygy Tablebases for 3,4 and 5 pieces
 - Integrated with lichess.org by Berserk

## Hopefully coming soon:
 - Openings Book
 - Zobrist Hashing
 - Transposition Table
 - Iterative Deepening
 - Maybe more...
